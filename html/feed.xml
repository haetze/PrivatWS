    The Covid19-Pandemic forced all of society to start adopting to digital infrastructure. 
    The Pandemic education sector incredibly hard. 
    This fact (probably) holds for the whole world. 
    German high-schools had to catch up to years of basically not evolving.

    <p>
    When politicians decided that schools are going all-digital, I was hoping they would spend some time teaching kids some useful skills around the tools they could use to accomplish school tasks.
    One pet-peeve of mine is version control.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>
    I keep a list of books I have read and what I thought about them for future reference later. 
    These thoughts are only for me to remind myself of what I felt while reading it. 
    I forgot so much about the other books I read, and I feel like this should help with that. 
    I usually don't care if there are a bunch of errors in these notes. 
    Therefore they are cheap to create for me. 
    This piece will be a little different. 
    I have so many thoughts about <i>Competing with Unicorns</i> by Jonathan Rasmusson that I felt the need to sort my thoughts more thoroughly. 
    If you want the one-sentence summary: ''Spotify is a great company to work for, and its management style is superior to anything else.''
    I'm not saying the statement is wrong, but it's so unreflected and uncritical. I will get to more details soon, but this is my first impression.
