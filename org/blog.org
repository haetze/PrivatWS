The Covid19-Pandemic forced all of society to start adopting to digital infrastructure. 
The Pandemic education sector incredibly hard. 
This fact (probably) holds for the whole world. 
German high-schools had to catch up to years of basically not evolving.

When politicians decided that schools are going all-digital, I was hoping they would spend some time teaching kids some useful skills around the tools they could use to accomplish school tasks.
One pet-peeve of mine is version control.
