# The main selling point of graphical interfaces is the ease of use.
# Graphical interfaces, in many cases, trade inefficiency to achieve this ease of use. 
# This trade is fair for most consumer use cases, but as soon as people need to use them in a professional setting, we need a higher efficiency ceiling.
# In this work, I'm going to explain why I think we need to require this higher ceiling, how we missed the last opportunity to get there and how I think we can do better.
